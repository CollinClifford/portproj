      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>
        I recently graduated from Thinkful’s software engineering boot camp in
        February. During my time at Thinkful, I gained a lot of experience using
        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as popular frameworks such as React
        and Express. I used RESTful API architecture to build beautiful backend
        applications combined with CRUD practices. I also delved deep into Data
        Science and Algorithms where I learned how to craft code that is
        optimized for best performance using O(n) behavior. I’m well versed in
        PostgreSQL and have combined that information with Express.js and Knex
        to make highly functional websites with excellent and secure relation to
        databases hosted on ElephantSQL. The whole while at Thinkful I relied
        heavily on Google Chrome Developer Tools to troubleshoot my code and
        make sure my websites were not only functional but in the good standing
        order.

        Prior to Thinkful, I was a career Restaurant Manager. I worked for a
        large company that had multiple locations throughout Portland, Oregon. I
        started there by working in the cafe but through my resilience and grit
        grew with the company to ultimately managing multiple locations and
        departments. At times, I lead a team of 25-100 members (numbers
        reflecting the fluctuation of employees during the pandemic) who I
        worked closely with and considered as integral to the success of the
        business as my supervisors. I never spoke down to my staff and I
        understood the importance of every member of the team by actively
        listening to input and doing my best to correct concerns. I used my
        critical thinking to develop ways to keep expenses down and net income
        high. I had a highly adaptable cross-trained team who were able to flow
        into multiple positions and keep labor costs down. I reduced waste by
        streamlining menus and keeping inventory low. I displayed excellent
        time-management skills by being able to successfully keep track of
        inventory and ordering amongst multiple locations across multiple days
        by use of strict rituals. I think the practices and disciplines I
        learned while managing would make me a great addition to any
        team. I company forward, desire growth, and hold myself highly
        accountable. I have strong attention to detail and believe in best
        practices in development as well as in the workplace. I love to learn
        and I strive to be better in my role within the company every single
        day. I am not sedentary and the bottom line is never good enough for me.
        I love working in a crew and I value each and every person I meet and
        know there’s always something to learn by listening.
